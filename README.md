The story begins when Kartik was 18years old and he used to live in India
he likes to watch anime and was amazed from its Premium animation & Storyline quality.
One day "Kartik" Noticed that in his own country India there was a rough point
mentallity among society about the Animation or Cartoon or Anime that they are only for kids
and animation studios of that time dont make animation of Great quality and story as they focus
more on making money rather than quality of content as compared to Japan which has world's best animation Studios
and directors.

Kartik thought deeply regarding this topic and decided to fix this false point of view by opening its own Animation studios
which not only revolutionize the Animation industry in India but also change the Thought Aspects
about Animation in society.This studio not only focus on Kids but also Make sure people of every age group will
love our work.

At that time Kartik was thinking about the name he want to give to its Animation Studio.At that time
Kartik Loves One Anime character "ZeroTwo" 

"ZeroTwo" is a fictional character from 2018 Japanese series name Darling in the Franxx
and it was most favourite anime character Kartik likes so he decide to name his Animation studio
after her name.
